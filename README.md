## Introduction

As two friends who embarked on our culinary journey together a few years back, we discovered our passion for cooking amidst our computer science studies. This shared adventure not only brought us closer but also sparked an idea: to create an application that simplifies the process of finding and following both simple and complex recipes. We noticed a gap in the market – very few platforms offer the level of detail required for complete novices to achieve commendable results in the kitchen. Driven by our experiences and challenges as budding chefs, we set out to bridge this gap. Our mission is to democratize cooking, making it accessible and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their culinary skill level. Through our application, we aim to empower users to cook with confidence, explore new cuisines, and share their own creations, all while fostering a community of like-minded food enthusiasts.
